"""NPC PvE debug system (PLAN.md §4.4, D17).

Public surface:

* ``npc.spec`` — typed, validated ``NpcSpec`` (stage) + enemy definitions, the
  name -> engine character id mapping, and the skill damage table.
* ``npc.policy`` — :class:`npc.policy.NpcPolicy` (deterministic greedy + rotation).
* ``npc.objectives`` — challenge-objective judging + three-star decision.
* ``npc.eval`` — stage x seed evaluation entry (win rate + three-star rate).
